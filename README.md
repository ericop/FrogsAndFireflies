## How to Install on Windows

1. From https://github.com/ericop/FrogsAndFireflies on desktop click Clone or download then Download ZIP (File includes all builds, etc. so its over 200MB)
2. Unzip FrogsAndFireflies-master.zip to something like `C:\Users\{YourWindowsUserName}\Downloads\FrogsAndFireflies-master`
3. Go into `C:\Users\{YourWindowsUserName}\Downloads\FrogsAndFireflies-master\FrogsAndFireflies-master\builds` and double click `Frogs And Fireflies Windows.v4.2.exe`
- Note: For Windows builds, it needs the `Frogs And Fireflies Windows.v4.2_Data` directroy and all that's in it and the `Frogs And Fireflies Windows.v4.2.exe` to function. If those are all you want you can drag them both to your Desktop, etc. and the `Frogs And Fireflies Windows.v4.2.exe` should still play just fine and you can delete the rest of the files in `C:\Users\{YourWindowsUserName}\Downloads\FrogsAndFireflies-master\`
